# Implementing-Gradient-Descent-and-Log-Loss-and-Sigmoid-Activation-Function
1. Implemented Gradient Descent Function without using TensorFlow
<br>
2. Implemented Log Loss without using TensorFlow to calculate the Loss in the Neural Network Model the lesser the loss the better the model performs 
<br>
3. Implemented Sigmoid Activation Function to calculate the summation of weights and bias without using TensorFlow
